A platform to hack


# Heckr.

Social media platforms like Twitter are really good at propagating information and let's you write short tweets to quickly
share your thoughts with the world. The Twitter tech community is filled with noise and can be overwhelming or annoying sometimes
especially for mere software hackers. I know of a lot of people who are just around to hack stuff together and share it with other 
people who are like-minded but it hardly get's attention. 

What strives the most on Twitter are shitposts or tweets about startups or products i.e SaaS, Courses, Books and what have you.

Sometimes, we just want to hack together software and share with others for the fun of it. Checkout [just-for-fun-no-really](https://justforfunnoreally.dev)

Hack Club is a great community for teens who just want to hack software and share -- I encourage you to try it. Unfortunately it uses Slack 
which I don't appreciate much. 

Buildergroop is good, but I feel like it is still too close to tech Twitter. The teens building there seem to be very much tilted towards building
startups or working in a company (though sometimes they work on cool stuff).

As for me, I would prefer a platform that encourages hackers to share what they're working on without feeling the pressure of tech buzzwords.
I want a platform that encourages hackers to do nice things, with their skills and ultimately have fun. It should feel like the internet when big tech
companies had not taken over it just yet. 

I want to create the platform that is hackable, for hackers, and by hacking technologies together. Something weird, but interesting and fun.

## Some ideas I think will be cool to have

- The design should be minimalistic and simple. Not too ugly or too beautiful like designs of today. Just a few colours (probably just black and white)

- Everyone has his/her profile page that he can customize to fit his/her style using web technologies.

- No concept of followers and following. Your profile can be starred as a sign of appreciation from other poeple. The platform has a main screen that always show the latest hack by other poeple and a page to see the latest hack by people you have starred.
